## Installation

1. `Error: release openreplay failed, and has been uninstalled due to atomic being set`

    a. This might be because of failed helm installation. To debug, follow the below steps:

        ```bash
        openreplay -s

        # If you see any failed pods, check the log. it should shed some light.
        openreplay -l <pod name>

        # If there is no pods in running/error/crashloop status, then check the status of pod using following command
        kubectl describe po -n app -n db <pod name>
        ```

## Signup is not working

1. Health check shows SSL check failed:
  
   a. If you've a self-signed certificate, you can use the following command to fix it:

       ```bash
       openreplay -e

       # Add following line to skip the SSL health check
       chalice:
         env:
           ...
           ...
           # append the following line under env section
           SKIP_H_SSL: true
       ```

    save and quit the config file using `:wq`
    

## My installation suddenly stopped working
   
There might be multiple reasons for that. Here's how you can debug the situation:

1. Check the status of Installation, using `openreplay -s`

    a. Check the disk usage section. If it's more than 80%, the services won't run.

## Upgrade failed without any particular error
   
### I see "helm or another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress"

This usually means that you retried the installation/upgrade operation multiple times. Run the below command to resolve the situation:

```bash
helm rollback -n app openreplay
```

### I see no errors, just "installation failed"

```bash
# Check for failed pods
kubectl get pods -n app --field-selector="status.phase!=Succeeded,status.phase!=Running" -o custom-columns="POD:metadata.name"
        
# Check for the err logs
openreplay -l `pod name from above`
 ```
